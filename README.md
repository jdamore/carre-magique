Solution to the TW magic square problem

*Requirements*
With a positive integer x as input, build and print the magic square of order x (hence all the numbers from 1 to x^2 in a grid with equal

We will be looking for:
- Clean code
- Evidence of TDD
- A go script
- A readme

- we need to manipulate matrices
- will output a x-matrix
- will take an integer x as an input (will return error if not a positive integer)
- command line based as our MVP. Looking at Django server-based setup if we go further
- arbitrarily, we will support a response time of less than 10 seconds for a number up to 10M


*To-Do*
- write the program
